# Overview

> This page should appear as the homepage for kiara docs, and should make it clear to any potential user what kiara is, and why they might want to use it, even if they've never heard of kiara before.

Something along the lines of using data and digital techniques to do research is a good thing to do, but...

Keeping track of where your data came from and what you did to it is hard because

- writing and versioning code is hard?
- jupyter makes it easy to lose track of what you ran when?
- keeping records of where you got your data from is hard?
- you might need to use lots of tools/programs/languages and import/export your data a lot?

kiara helps with all of these things by

- you don't have to write (much) code
- everything is a pipeline, so you always know what steps ran when on what data
- and your pipeline encodes everything about the process, so its repeatable and shareable
- all in one tool to do all tasks, with lots of plugins, easily extensible to your domain

Use kiara to solve your problems like

- i'm a researcher and i just want a nice way to show how i got the data together for my open data set
- i lead a research group and i want to share easy and repeatable ways to do common tasks within my group and more widely
- i'm a techincal domain expert and i want researchers to be able to apply methods i know about to their data
