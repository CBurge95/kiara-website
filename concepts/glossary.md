# Terms

> There's loads of terms thrown around when talking about kiara, which have very specific meanings in this context. We should define the main ones, and when we use those terms in other prose, link to here. I (caro) am super vague on what most of these things actually mean, this existing would be super helpful for me!

## what's a kiara module?

explain this both high level - what does a module mean to a user? some collection of things kiara can do
and at a low level - a module is a python class which subclasses something?

## what's a kiara plugin?

again, high level and low level explanation. link out to how to make a plugin tutorial

## what's a kiara pipeline?

a pipeline isn't a workflow? link out to pipeline tutorial

## what's a workflow?

we kinda use this to mean 2 things, the steps a researcher does to get some results from some data, and a specific kind of file?
[Some of this information also relevant?](https://dharpa.org/kiara/latest/design_docs/architecture/workflows/#the-workflow-lifecycle), maybe we even want a whole page on workflows as a concept?

## what's a data type?

steps (/operations??) only work on specific data types, they can be something simple like a boolean (true/false) or a string, or complicated like a table with a specific structure

technically, they are a python class that subclasses something??

## what's an operation?

## what's a model?

## What's the data store?

maybe this wants a whole page, link also to architecture and reproducible research/lineage. What does it mean to onboard data into kiara, how does it track lineage etc

## what's kiara context
